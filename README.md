Future Value Calculator
This is a simple program that calculates the future value of an investment with compound interest, based on the principal, interest rate, and time period entered by the user. The program also displays a chart of the future value over time.
Getting started
To use the program, you will need Python 3 and the following modules installed:
	tkinter
	matplotlib
To install these modules, you can use pip:

pip install tkinter 
pip install matplotlib

Once you have installed the modules, you can run the program by running the future_value_calculator.py script:

python future_value_calculator.py

How to use the program
When you run the program, a window will appear with input fields for the principal, interest rate, and time period, as well as a "Calculate" button and a chart of the future value over time.

To use the program, follow these steps:

	Enter the principal (the initial amount of the investment).
	Enter the interest rate (the annual percentage rate of interest).
	Enter the time period (the number of years the investment will be held).
	Click the "Calculate" button to calculate the future value and display the chart.
	The program will calculate the future value of the investment using the compound interest formula:



where:
•	FV is the future value of the investment
•	P is the principal
•	r is the interest rate
•	t is the time period

The program will then display a chart of the future value over time, as well as the final future value in a label below the chart.
